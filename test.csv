​I'm being cyberbullied and I'm going into a bad mind set. I'm afraid if this gets too far I might do something. Please help me. ,
"​My mom just signed me up for summer camp. It's about job interests and fun activities. At first I was excited, but now I feel scared. I'm worried that I might not survive. I'm worried that I might not make to the restroom. And I'm worried that my belongings will get stolen! My Mom told me to just give it a chance and that I will do fine, but I didn't believe her! I don't know what to do! ",
"Hi, My best friend recently has been getting into drugs and alcohol and going off the rails (giving herself piercings, sneaking out...) and every time I see her she brings it up and offers to me. She either offers smoking or drinking. I've told her, no I'm not doing any drugs and yet she still asks. I've told her I don't support it. I don't feel comfortable hanging out with her anymore because I feel like a bore or that I'm lame. We haven't talked in a little while and I miss her. But I don't miss the new her. Do you have any advice? ​",
"​I've constantly been feeling depressed. It's started in 3rd grade, and has gotten worse. I'm now in 8th grade. I have been having thoughts of suicide. I tend to purposefully not eat to harm myself. I have low self-esteem. I've tried telling my parents about it, but they didn't believe me. Now I really want to get rid of my pain and kill myself. I just need some help and reassurance. ​",
​I guess recently I've really messed up and am pretty overwhelmed. I've started taking some of my friend's antidepressants because my mom doesn't believe in the disorder and I want help. I'm being threatened because of my previously stated mess up. The threats and things people have said have basically made me hate myself. Everything they're saying is partly true and I'm starting to believe it. The whole situation is just making me feel pretty super horrible. I'd love to be able to speak with someone who knows what's up and could actually help me through it. ,
"​I’m not sure if this classifies as assault/sexual assault but the guy held me so I couldn’t leave. He tried kissing me multiple times and I didn’t want to kiss him. I told him to stop but he didn’t. He pulled my hair to keep my head up and he gave me a hickey. I told everyone it was a bruise, friend’s included. But I would like to forget that night ever happened and I don’t know what to do. ​",
"Please help me with an overwhelming challenge to get over. Okay so last night I had to split up my parents fighting. After I saw my dad put his hands on my mom, I was overwhelmed with sadness and anger, and after I threatened to call the cops on him he left. I basically told him to get out of the house. So today I honestly don't want to talk to my dad nor really see him. Please give me advice on how to get past this because this has left me emotionally drained and a little scared of my dad, even though I don't think he would ever hurt me. Is it even normal to experience these emotions? Honestly I could not sleep just thinking about all of this. ​",
"​Okay so recently my parents got into a big argument and now they are getting a divorce. I honestly talked to my mom and like it just wasn't the argument, it was multiple reasons she was divorcing my dad. Honestly right now I feel emotionally drained, a little sad, and angry at them because of this. Do you have any advice for what to do now in this situation and how to just cope? ​​",
"​Hi, I'm sorry to bother you whoever you may be. My parents have been fighting a lot lately and I just need someone to talk to. ​There's probably more important people out there than me though, so it's okay if you don't respond. ​",
"I don't know what to do. My family hates me. All the time they are verbally harassing me. Telling me that I am a terrible person, telling me that I am a disappointment. Anytime I am around them I have to walk on eggshells. I can't win. Nothing I do is right. To them I always have an ulterior motive for everything I do.  ",
​I feel sad and anxious most of the time. I go to sleep late and awake in the afternoon on the next day. I can't find a job that I like. I have the love of my life but it’s not enough for me to be happy. I’m afraid many times. I don’t eat healthy. ,
"​Hey, I'm overwhelmed with my classes and I don't know where to start. When I try to start studying I feel super unmotivated and I don't know what to do. I have 2 exams in like 4 days . ",
"Hey I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve tried everything to feel happy these past couple of years, and it has become nearly impossible to be happy. I just feel so lost. It’s like I feel so tired and feel so sad all the time. I question everything... my worth, every compliment, every single hug I receive. Every time I feel happy I tell myself, “it’s not going to last long” so why bother getting excited about feeling something other than sad. Ever since that terrible day that I found out that my mom had ended her own life, my life has been horrible. I get all my anger and sadness out through self hatred and self harm, but obviously that isn’t helping... so I’m sitting here arguing with the demons in my head whether I should end myself or not. I know things won’t get better so what’s the point? ​",
​I just feel like I don't fit in at school and everyone talks behind my back?! ,
"​I was recently involved in a car accident. I happened to be on my phone at the time and when I looked up I had to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting the person that suddenly stopped in front of me. The person behind me started to skid and slammed into the back of my car. I told the police officer that responded that the reason I had to slam on my brakes was because of my phone and he seemed to be very understanding and tried to tell me that the other was at fault because it could have been a squirrel or a dog or whatever that ran out in front of me causing me to stop and they still would have hit me. I can't get over this sense of guilt that this whole accident could have been prevented if I hadn't been so stupid and been on my phone while driving. I am terrified to get behind the wheel, constantly nauseous, and don't want to be on my phone at all even when I'm home or in the passenger seat. I need help. ",
Hey. I just want my mom to trust me again and I need help on where to start.,
"​Hi, lately I've been feeling very miserable in school. I don't want to do my work (but I am!) because I'm getting bad thoughts from my depression. I wish I could tell my teachers what's going on in my mind, but I wouldn't want them to think I was in danger and call my parents or the hospital. Some of my teachers do know I have depression, they just don't know how bad it is. Heck, I don't even know how bad it is, but I'm feeling really worthless and miserable. I'm not really sure what else to do for coping skills, I'd like to try journaling, but can't really find the time to do so. I'm not really sure what else to do about school. I'm really stressed out by my thoughts and work at school. I really just want to relax.",
"​I’m writing today because school is super super stressful this year. I’m on my fourth week of senior year and I’ve never had a school year as hectic/confusing as this one. I get insane amounts of homework, and I have two classes that are really hard and I don't really understand anything half the time, so I rely on online videos but those can’t directly explain how to do the problems I need to do. It’s really hard to manage my time because after school I have practice and games for my sport and I just really don’t see myself passing the classes I need to pass. I already want to give up because there’s no way I can balance everything until my sport season is over in 2 months. I’ve never failed a class before and have never struggled nearly as hard as I am now, and I really don’t know what to do. My entire weekends are swallowed by school, I do nothing but work from the moment I’m home to the moment I go to bed and I really hate it and it makes me insanely upset and frustrated. ",
"​I have a pet that is, sadly, nearing the end of his life. I haven’t had to deal with the death of a pet or loved one before and need some advice as to how I could help comfort them. Thank you in advance! ",
​I feel like my family members are always mad or annoyed at me. They make me feel like I don't matter. This doesn't help with my self esteem since I already think bad things about my self. I feel like I was a mistake or that I am useless. Nobody cares everybody always finds a way to say I did something wrong. Even friends find a way to say I did something wrong. Some times I feel like cutting I've done it twice. I don't know how to handle this.  I want to disappear.,
​Hey. I have been single for a long time. And at times I get lonely wondering why guys my age don't approach me. In class I'm pretty timid but as soon as I talk to people I open up really fast. A lot of the guys at my school barely talk to me because they feel intimidated by my shyness. But I want them to know I'm a great person. How do I do that? ,
​I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately by school. I just started my sophomore year of high school and my grades are already getting bad. It seems like when I get one grade up then another goes down. I try to stay after school to get the help I need to have better grades but It's not working. Whenever I get happy about a good test score or a good grade on a homework assignment I remember that I have still have bad grades and i get sad about it. ,
"I’ve used this multiple times, and it does work well I just haven’t in awhile. I am not in rush to receive help I just wanted to get this out to someone. I don’t feel comfortable calling so just please I don’t want to be pressured into that. This is how I like to communicate, and I’m good with the wait. I just wanted to talk about how lonely I am at college right now. I don’t even know if you guys talk to college kids because I used this mainly in high school, but I thought the least that could happen is you guys tell me you can’t help me because I am not a teenager. I have been in school almost a month, and was so excited to start over and a new life, but I am more lonely now then I was back home. I was self harming before I got here, and I told myself because this is a fresh start I won’t go down that road. But I am so lonely I can’t find any friends who want to hang out with me, and I haven’t said anything of my past to make them feel this way. It’s like no one loves me, or nobody would know if I went home. Even if I went home I would be back at McDonalds and be lonely again. I’m not sure want to do. I tried to get involved but I don’t know where anything is. I go out to dinner on campus, and just sit by myself because even when I do sit next to someone they don’t talk to me. I’m invisible and no one would care if I am gone. My question is how do I make myself known and find people who care about me. I’m just so sad and lonely. ​",
"My sister has expressed interest in hurting herself earlier this evening. My dad met her at a stop sign on his way home from work. He rolled down his window to talk to her and she was balling and said she hates her life. She said she was thinking about hurting herself. She just started a new job last week, so we are unsure if we should call 911 or not. We don’t want to ruin her chance at this job. But we also don’t want to ignore it. After she talked about hurting herself, she went out for a drive with a friend to talk. She has since said she is “fine.” But she clearly is not fine. We told her we were thinking about calling 911, she responded by saying don’t do that, its not like that. She has never talked like this before. She apparently got into a fight with a guy she likes this past week, so we think this is part of the reasoning, but there has to be more than that going on for her to feel this way and express it. What do you recommend we do? ​",
​Hi. I am facing problems for a year now. My parents don't approve of  my relationship as I am an Asian and my boyfriend is an American. I wanted to talk to them but I find it really scary and it stresses me a lot that they are not fully agreeing on our relationship. It hurts. ,
"​I don’t know if I’ve ever actually been in love, but there’s a person who I really thought I was in love with. This all started two years ago, and ended after 7 or so months. We were off and on until about a year, until distancing ourselves except a few check ins here and there. this person did me very wrong, and it’s too much to get into and honestly really stupid, but the end result was fairly bad. We’ve remained friends up until this point, like I said, we normally message each other here and there to see how we’re both doing. This person was the only person I felt like I could truly be myself with. I was completely, totally comfortable with telling them everything, and I haven’t found anyone like them since. I’ve been in a battle with myself for a very, very long time, because I miss them, but I don’t know if I miss them because have feelings for them, or if I miss them because I miss what we had, or perhaps I miss being able to be so open with someone. I think about them often, but I made the choice to block all their social media and remove their number from my phone, so there's no way for them to contact me. I fight the urge everyday to run back to them, and it’s really frustrating to still care so much about this person and to want to have this person in my life when I know they don’t deserve my attention and my care anymore, not after what they did. distracting myself is getting harder and harder to do, and it feels like I’ll never get over them, or this. ",
"Today’s my first day of senior year and I’m freaking out about the way I look, when I definitely need to be freaking out over more important things like college and life after high school. two days ago I went school shopping, and I tried on countless pairs of jeans that didn't fit. I know high school and the things people say in high school won't matter in a year when I'm off in college, but I've seemed to always struggle with things like this. I never fit right into any jeans, my hair never looks right, and it’s very hard and stressful to be at school and look at everyone’s jeans that do fit them, and do make them look good. I don’t ever feel comfortable in my own skin and it’s to the point where I don’t want to do anything but remain inside. I don’t know what to do anymore, I'm really at a loss.",
"Hi, I'm just feeling pretty bad right now and don't feel like I have anyone to talk to. I wanted to chat but it wasn't available and I don't want to call since it's late and my parents could hear. I don't know how long these can be or if anyone wants to hear about my stupid problems anyway but I just feel really sad right now. I have anti depressants but I haven't been taking them because I feel off whether I'm on or off them. I had one passion left which is my youth group and we have board training tomorrow (I'm president) and I feel no desire to go to it. It's the last thing I have going for me and I'm not enjoying it anymore. I'd never take my own life but I have really strong thoughts of hopelessness and no therapist because we can't afford one. Sometimes I wish I could just walk to a mental hospital/inpatient and say I want help but I also would want to be able to be in my own bed at night if that makes sense. I don't want the commitment but I just want help. I was feeling a little bit better about a half hour ago and then one thing happens that isn't even big and now I feel terrible again. I wonder if I'll ever be normal and not beat myself up after one inconvenience. A0nyway if you read this email I'm sorry its so long/negative. I just feel really bad. Thank you for taking the time to read.",
​I know I have problems but I feel like I don’t deserve help I feel like I’ve made up all of my problems and I can’t get away from the guilt I want to be happy. I don’t know how to get over my made up guilt. I want to put everything into this message but I’m scared I’m scared that I'll have something truly wrong with me. Please help me ,
"​I'm writing today because I'm starting to feel hopeless again. There's not much that can make me happy anymore. I'm about to start senior year in less than a month, and the thought of having to do so keeps me up at night because it makes me so anxious. I haven't gotten the community service hours I need for a scholarship because I'm too anxious to go out and volunteer at a place, and I also just don't have the energy or the will for it. I don't have a job, which means at this rate I won't be able to afford anything in college, which isn't very far away. There's nothing I want to do with my life, I don't want to work, I don't want to do anything anymore, I just want to sleep. I'm afraid of having to face reality. I don't feel much of anything anymore, but when I do, it's usually nothing but pain or anger towards myself.",
"​Hello, I think I might have anger problems. My anger meter goes through the roof over something little or over things that I shouldn't get so upset about. I don't know why I get so angry and it's very frustrating. I tried explaining to my mom about it, but she doesn't understand what I'm going through and just sees me getting upset over nothing like a brat. I tell her I hate feeling this way and don't enjoy it at all. It often gets to the point where I get so angry I want to physically hurt someone (even though I would never do that). I can't tell anyone about this because I'm afraid of what they'll think of me. So I mostly get the urge to take it out on myself. And I don't tell anyone about me hurting myself either, so when I get angry I feel so trapped not knowing how to calm myself. The intense anger wears off eventually but I don't think it's normal to get so angry I have these thoughts and feelings. Thanks for listening. ",
"​I will start my junior year at a new high school in 3 weeks. I am super scared. Already I know this school is a better fit I get to take college classes and be on a swim team, and they’ll push me harder. I even got accepted and it’s really hard to get in because it’s a college based charter school. Yet I am nervous no friends and they don’t know about my issues. I don’t know how to tell them either. My counselor wants to meet with the school counselor but I have to tell the school counselor but I can never reach her. I am doing so much better what if I relapse because of this. I am already sleep walking again which is what I do when I am to stressed and anxious. I don’t want to bring up my worries in therapy because in October they want to release me of all my outpatient services except my meds. What do I do? What if I get picked on or bullied again? What if they think I am a crazy person like my last school? Help me please. And sorry it’s so long. ",
"​I have been having some issues with my mom. She calls me names and says that I am pathetic because I don't do things the way she wants me to do them but I am doing my best and I don't know what she wants. It has gotten to the point where I hate even considering her my mother, it just keeps getting worse and worse.",
​There are rumors being spread about me all throughout my neighborhood and it has stopped my whole street from talking to me. Only three people still talk to me. Is their anyway you may point me in the way I should be handling this? ,
"​I need your advice on like dealing with parents divorcing. I honestly just found out that my parents are gonna go thru with it, and I'm just feeling kind of down and mad and sad about the overall situation. Are these emotions even normal if I'm 18 and still live at home with one of them? I feel like overall them communicating with each other and them communicating with me will be a lot different but please give me advice on how to deal with this.",
"​I need some advice. So I just turned 18 and I will be starting college soon. I feel like there is a lot of pressure on me to like get a job, and then getting my license, but to be honest I'm just taking it slowly but I will be getting them surely soon. Any advice on how to like not let the pressure get to me? Also any advice on my mom telling me I don't really contribute to the household by helping out but I do, I do the dishes, laundry, and other stuff to help her out but I feel like she just doesn't notice it and it makes me sad and angry but any advice on what to do there too? ",
"​I'm depressed beyond imagination, and yet I keep moving because I know I have things to do, but I want to kill myself often.... I really think I have a mental illness and I know I need help. ",
"​Hello, this is not affecting me directly but it’s about my girlfriend of 2 years. So I have noticed that her dad was abusive verbally on the phone a couple minutes ago and he’s very degrading to her and he makes her feel terrible and he does this on a daily basis and it makes me so upset, but I don’t know what I can do about it. I want her to be happy but I don’t know how. ",
"​Hello. So, I've recently lost a lot of weight. A LOT. I've lost about 40 lbs. in the last 5 months. I worked so hard. And it has felt absolutely amazing. I'm more energized, I don't get headaches anymore, and I'm so much healthier. The problem is that sometimes I'm afraid I'll go back to my old eating habits. That I'll gain all the weight back. That I'll never get to my goal weight. That I'll have back rolls and arm fat again. That I'll get high blood pressure (runs on my dad's side). That no matter how much I lose, I'll always compare myself to other girls. I just want to be beautiful and healthy. Any advice? ",
"​The past maybe 8 months, I have been so terrible to my parents. I have been misbehaving and stressing them out so much, I have been pushing and pushing, and I'm scared someone will snap soon. I really don't mean to do any of this and I truly feel terrible, but I used to lie a lot so they don't believe me when I say I'm sorry, and most of the time after I say sorry I will do something wrong again. My parent make assumptions about the way I think towards everyone in the household, and I never think any of the things they say. I tell them this but they just shut me down and say that that is how I am coming across. They continuously ask me why I continue to act so terrible and why I continue to push. I never know what to say because I don't know myself. I am struggling internally every day because I don't know what is going to happen. I am also going through a phase where I feel so sad every day. I think I have some sort of depression and anxiety thing going on, I have told my parents this but they say that that is not an excuse for all of my behavior. I'm constantly scared of coming home and messing up, I have told one of my friends and they said I could go to her house for a few nights. I have almost done this on so many occasions but never do. I feel like maybe I should just for a bit so that everyone gets some space and we can all just have some time away from each other. But I really don't know and I need help, please. ",
"Summer depression is hitting me really hard this year. School is my life and not having the homework and somewhere to go every day and things to keep me and my mind occupied is making me really depressed. I've signed up for summer activities and camps, and I'm even taking online classes, but there's still that time where I can't keep myself busy with activities. This is where I just start feeling like crap and like my life is worthless. I don't know what else I can do... ",
I have a friend who began cutting himself due to complications with his girlfriend. How should I approach him without getting mad and what should I say to help him get through it? ,
Due to some family conflicts I am unable to seek therapy or counseling. I've been suffering from depression and recently relapsed after a really high point in my recovery. A friend recommended this email service while I try to convince my family to get me a therapist. Thank you for your time. ​,
"I got informed that my family is moving half way across the country a couple of months ago to a state in the Southwest, and it's really hitting me hard. I've lived on the West Coast for all of my life. I have a close lifelong friend of mine that I've known since first grade that I'll never able to see again. My house is a mess of boxes and paint cans for getting ready to leave and fixing up the house. Every now and then I just get waves of tears with no warning, just like that. I keep hearing the same things from friends, family, and acquaintances that ""everything gonna be ok"" and ""it's not that hard"". The thing that makes me most sad is that my best friend doesn't seem to care or notice. I seek advice. I don't want to send false information, so here's some clearing up: I don't feel voiceless or helpless, just discombobulated and sad. I feel like a tortoise that doesn't want to go anywhere, but has a storm incoming that it HAS to move for. Most of the ""waves"" come in or are triggered when I look at the half painted spots in the walls and boxes cluttering the garage. I don't see anything wrong with my situation that I should be sad about, yet I still am and I need help. Thank you guys so much.",
​Sometimes I feel alone...it's been two years since my dog died..I feel empty without her..I act happy around people but when I'm in my room I cry.... ​,
"​So I'm an eighth grader, and I've been basically in love with this kid in my grade since we met forever ago, and I don't really know what to do, because we don't really get along, which is what makes me caring about him so much so weird. I've literally tried everything to get over him but I just can't. And my friends say he's dumb and stuff, you know, like any normal friend says about anyone you would like, but it makes me so mad. Like, I just don't know what to do with my life anymore, and I don't know what to do about him.",
"People are starting to worry about me. I've attempted a few months ago and the people at church knew about it. Now, things have been getting tough and now people are starting to worry I might do something. They're noticing my cuts and I'm scared. I don't know what to do. Help??",
​Hello. So I have been in a relationship for almost a year. I feel like we have been growing apart. We are not talking as much anymore. In the beginning I was really excited to be in this relationship but now I have more and more instances where I wish I was single. Mostly because I just get stressed about it sometimes. But there is no real problems about it. Our personalities clash sometimes. But I'm not a confrontational person at all. So I'm afraid to say anything. I'm just in a weird place. ,
"​Hi. I'm just feeling a bit anxious about something. I have recently gotten into my dream college. I am quite excited, but also nervous. It's in a different state, which means I'm starting over in a whole new environment. I'll have to make new friends, but I'm scared I won't be able to. I don't have many friends now. You'd think at 20 I'd know how to socialize. But I'm just such a quiet/timid person. My question is, how can I get over this anxiety of starting over in a new place, and this fear that I won't make any new friends? ",
"​Hello. I just wanted to write about a small problem I've been having. My boyfriend broke up with me about nine months ago, and I'm still furious about what he did. I'm essentially over him, but it's as if I can't forget the things he did. I can't help but remember how rude he was, as well as selfish, controlling, and vain. He made fun of my hobbies, and was inconsiderate of my anxiety. Most of all, he tried to pressure me into sex when I wasn't ready. These thoughts still make my blood BOIL, even though our relationship has been over for a long time. Is there any way I can put him out of my mind once and for all?",
"​I'm sorry if I am bothering any of you or anything... It's just that lately, I'm becoming more and more afraid of growing up, most especially since I'm about to finish middle school. I just wanted to talk to someone who can maybe help me... Again, sorry. ",
"​Is it bad that I carry around a blade? Like... I don’t carry it around so I can cut, even though that’s what it was intended for. I carry it around because it calms me down. It calms me knowing that I can cut when I want to, but I know I won’t. I don't want to cut. I haven't cut in over a month. But, it still calms me that I have my little “tool” around.",
​Thanks so much for your help. I've calmed down and I told my mom the thing I've been going through and she decided to get a divorce with my step-dad. We are going to move in a trailer house with my brother and I feel much better. I couldn't have done this without you guys. You guys helped me to be brave and stand up. I appreciate everything. ,

"Okay I need some advice. My parents have been split up about almost 2 years now, and it has been a little different but my parents still talk and get along with each other pretty good. I feel I just cannot adjust to staying at 2 houses, and I feel I stay at my moms more than my dads all of the time. I can stay at my dads fine, but I don't feel the same way as if I were at my moms. I mean I am thankful to be able to stay at both parents houses, but is this feeling of me not still being adjusted to staying at my dads normal? Please give me advice on how to like deal with this. ",
"I have been cutting for a little while now. I just recently started cutting my arm, I play softball and we got new types of uniforms with are short sleeves and we don't have our long sleeves yet. I realized that someone may see the cuts. This made me think that I should tell someone. I was wondering what do I say to them to tell them what I am doing? ",
"I don't talk to my brother anymore and he doesn't talk to me. Unless during family gatherings when we pretend as if everything's fine in front of our relatives. Most of the time we act as if the other just doesn't exist anymore. I've never been okay with that but I'm afraid of him and I'm afraid that if we ever start talking again, we'll only end up fighting. My brother is 18, a year older than me. We used to be pretty close as kids but we drifted apart as we grew up. He became verbally and physically abusive to me to the point that when he would just walk towards me and I would flinch and cry. I never told anyone. So at present, everyone pretty much thinks I'm overacting when they notice I never really liked hanging out or even talking to him. I still love him though. Although I'm sure he wouldn't be so physically abusive to me now that we're old enough to know what's right and wrong, I'm still afraid of him. I think that's one thing ""love"" can never cure. I want us to be okay. Sometimes I'd look at him and see a glimmer of hope that maybe someday we can fix what was broken. But I don't know, maybe I can only hope. ",
"​I don’t really know how this works just yet, but here goes nothing. I have this crush on one of my closest friends. And I really do cherish and absolutely adore everything about her, I miss her all the time, even when I just said goodbye a few minutes ago, and I really want to tell her how I feel and how much I appreciate her. I’m somewhat sure that she might feel the same way about me too! But I’m far too anxious to tell her how I feel, every time I start to try and get myself to send her a message or say something to her I freeze up and end up not accomplishing anything. I’ve thought about writing a heartfelt letter or note to her but I don’t know if I have the willpower to get myself to actually send anything. Help.",
"​I have anxiety attacks daily, if I get chest pain, arm pain etc. I automatically start freaking out thinking I'm having a heart attack. I'm currently having one (panic attack). It's debilitating. I can't enjoy life, I'm always worried. I'm just ready for this to be over, I'm miserable all the time. ",
"​Hi. I don't know why its so hard for me to show affection for my parents. Even though my father tells me: 'I love you' I cant seem to respond back. Like something is keeping me from saying it. Shame maybe? I don't know, really. Sometimes I really want to say it but I coward out. I just don't feel comfortable or feel awkward when I say it. I can say it in texts or sometimes a call but that's hard at times too. I don't usually tell my mom I love her because we are not that type who tells each other this. We are not like other daughter and mother who talks about everything and are sweet to each other. I tell her some interesting things that happened at school sometimes but anything more personal than that I don't talk to them about it. Its not hard for me to get sweet and talk about it with some friends but to them I can't. Maybe not being understood keeps me from doing so? I don't really know.",
"My dad emotionally abuses me and neglects me on a regular basis. I barely talk to him but every time he talks to me it's to criticize me, and if I point anything out it's always my fault (basically just more criticism). I've been done with him for a long time and I want to sit down and actually talk about his issues at my therapist's office but I don't know what to do. There's countless things to say that I can't go through here and nowhere to start and he probably won't even listen to me. I'm afraid that if he gets too mad he'll just make my life hell back at home. I could move in with my mom (they're separated) but I'd rather not for multiple reasons. I guess what I'm asking is, how do I go about discussing his abuse? I want to try to clear the air one last time and if worse comes to worse, I'm out.",

"​My boyfriend has been going through bullying his whole life and this December he decided to end his life. I'm having a really hard time trying to stay positive but its hard. I have dealt with depression and everything before, but I don't want to go back to the way I was. So, how am I supposed to stay positive during this time of my life? Me and him have been best friends since we were in preschool. We did everything together and now it is hard for me to do any of those things that me and him did together. How do I get over that feeling of not wanting to do anything that me and him did? ",

"​I'm afraid to ask my mom if I can go to a professional doctor to get tested for mental health issues. I have taken several online tests and I know that I shouldn't just go off of those, but they all say I have severe depression which honestly I think I do, but I'm just so scared to ask her. I'm not really the type of person to open up and ask for help that often, usually I just keep to myself, but I think she should know. She knows that I used to cut, but I don't know if she had gotten anything else out of that conversation. I would just really like some advice about how I should tell her, because I'm just really scared.  ",
"​I am going through a very hard time right now. I have to move out of the house that I've lived in my whole life. My parents say that I won't have to go to a different school, but life is full of surprises. It scares me. We're not even sure of where we are going to go! I'm just so worried, but I don't want to talk about my feelings because everybody says the same things to me, or they just don't understand. I'm so lost...I'm writing all the time, because it helps me, but then my Mom says to stop and spend time with the family. Spending time with the family is always watching television, and I'm sick of watching television! I just want to write, read, and draw! I still understand the importance of family time, and I still enjoy it, but I don't enjoy watching TV all day, every day. I can't stand it anymore! ",
"​The thought of giving up/suicide hasn’t crossed my mind in 3 years. Until recently. My life has become very messy. Hurting people I love without realizing it. Causing them to feel sad or depressed. I know with time things will heal or whatever people say but it’s hard to have hope right now when my life is just falling apart. If the bills disappeared, guilt, insecurities, arguing, just hating myself in general from my attitude to the physical appearance. I feel like trash. I’m just tired of crying and screaming on the inside it’s time to talk before I end up too low.  ",
"​I am 19 years old. I am a sophomore in college and at the end of last year, I met the man of my dreams. He's everything I ever wanted... kind, soft, understanding, respectful. We managed to stay in touch over the summer and we saw each other a couple times. Over the summer, he asked me to be his girlfriend and I was ecstatic. I had never had a boyfriend before and he seemed like the right one. I was right! He has been incredible. He makes me feel like the only girl in the world. He decided to study abroad for second semester of this year. While I am very excited for him, I am going to miss him dearly. I am so in love with him. I have NEVER felt this way about anyone and it scares me. I would do anything for him. We only have three weeks of school left and I am feeling so depressed.

"​I'm in a terrible situation. I started having depression when I turned ten years old two years ago. My best friend killed himself and it had a huge effect on my life. Things started going down hill. Now I cut (sometimes burn or bruise) my wrists, ankles, thighs, and sometimes my stomach. I'm seeing my counselor at my school currently and she's working on getting me a therapist. She doesn't know I self harm because I certainly do not want her to call my mom about it. My mom already knows that I did it in the past, she just thinks I'm way better now. I don't know what to do because it's 3am and I'm crying thinking about suicide. Life is basically pointless though. All our lives we just work our butts off and then die... So, what's so wrong about dying early? I'm in a terrible place right now; I haven't harmed myself for two days and now I want to hurt myself. ",
"​Hello. My mom and I have been arguing yesterday and today over 2 events, both of which are at the same time. One is with friends, the other my grandparents. I was vaguely told of the one with my grandparents a few months ago, but never given a date, time or place. I scheduled a party with my friends a week ago for today (the day both events are on). Sadly I can’t go because my grandparents event has to take priority over my friend’s. I’m sad that I can’t go to the one with my friends since it will probably be more fun than the one with my grandparents, but my mom has gotten very angry that I haven’t just sucked it up and continued as normal because I’m missing the party I helped plan and have talked about for about one and a half weeks. I’ve been in my room most of the day with my mom (and Dad) telling me I made this bigger than it needed to be and I should just get over it because they miss things they want to do all the time. Am I being really selfish and sound like a bratty person, or do I have a legitimate reason? I came here for a non-biased viewpoint.  ",

Tired of being called retarded, toddler, stupid. Tired of the realization that the ""peace offerings"" are nothing more than bribes to keep me quiet. Tired of the threats about kicking me out of the house. There are only 3 things keeping me there. My cat (who technically is owned by my mother), My little brother, college.  ",

It's gotten so bad that I can't sleep at night because I'm in so much physical and mental pain, and I've been missing a lot of school too. I've tried talking to my mom about how I'm feeling but she thinks I'm faking it for an excuse to miss school but I'm not.

"​I believe that I am suffering from an eating disorder. I'm 15 and kinda lost at how to approach this.

"​I've been with this girl since the beginning of the summer now. I love her to death and want to marry her one day. I just. I'm being emotionally abusive and I don't want to be. It's not anger or threats or anything. It's coming from my own self hated from being bullied growing up along with a major lack of empathy. I keep on having manic depressive episodes that emotionally hurt her. My lack of empathy causes me to do stupid selfish crap sometimes that makes her feel uncared for, which is the exact opposite of true. I love this girl and would die for her. I'm scared of losing her and don't want to. I love her so much. ",
"​Hi, I'm not sure what to do its two problems, the last week I have been upset thinking about my best friend. She passed away two years ago and I still have her number in my phone. She died from cancer and my sister, who is older than me, was asking me why do I still have her number in my phone. My sister said that something is wrong with me for keeping it this long, I feel when I delete it she is gone forever. I hope this doesn't make me sound horrible. My second problem is something horrible happened to my father and I got really scared and I didn't know if the hospital was going to be able to save him. It took a while (over 9 hours) in surgery to help him. He's better now with some problems. He can't really walk now. I have started hiding food secretly in my room and I binge on it when everyone is gone or asleep. And I don't know what to do or stop. I am sorry for telling you about both of them I didn't know where else to go. When you have time can you please help me if you can?  ",
"​Last night a close friend texted me that he might have feelings for me. I hesitated to tell him how I felt. For some reason, I told him that I liked him, even though I don't. He started talking about dating and stuff. I think I made a big mistake telling him that I liked him. I honestly just want to be friends with him because I feel like our friendship will be ruined if we date. Also, I'm not comfortable dating with ANYONE, I have school and family to worry about. And also we are just 13. I don't know what to tell him. ",

So today it was somebody’s birthday at work, and they got him a cake and everything and sang him happy birthday, and I’m completely happy for him. But it also reminded me that birthdays have always been rough for me, to the point I just pretend my own doesn’t happen; that is, until my ex last year made wrote me this really sweet card that I still haven’t gotten rid of. The issue is, I still feel like that won’t ever happen again, and that this next birthday is gonna be the worst one yet because nobody is gonna remember and I’ll just hate it, and I’m so tired of feeling this way.  ",

What should I do? ",
​I need someone to talk to because I’ve been super depressed and my anxiety is worse than usual. I also started cutting again after a year of not doing it. It’s because my parents are fighting over me being gay and it’s been really stressful. My mom accepts me while my dad doesn’t really and I don’t know how to cope. ,
"​I’m regretting a lot of the decisions I’ve made in the past month. They aren’t the worst decisions but definitely not me. I met this boy through one of my friends (when we snuck out of her house- so not like us). He took me to homecoming and we had fun. He tried to kiss me last time we hung out. (I met him six weeks ago- we’ve hung out every weekend since). I’ve never had my first kiss and I’m worried that our relationship is going to turn into something I’m not comfortable with. I pushed all of my good, smart friends that loved me away for these “new friends” who are all just couples wanting to hang out so everyone can make out. I really don’t like the situation I’ve put myself in and I don’t know how to get out of it. I drank and smoked with them to be “cool” but this isn’t like me at all. I’m a good kid who obeys my parents, yet now I’m always doing what I know I shouldn't be and I just want my old friends back. ",
"​Dear whoever this is, I know it's stupid of me to get so hurt over a guy, but to be honest, I truly am. I just feel like every time I start liking a guy, the guy always ends up hurting me or they're only after one thing or they end up not feeling the same way. Well I like this guy, he's a sophomore and I'm a freshman we've been sort of talking I guess and at the homecoming game Friday he was talking to me and flirting with me a little and today he hasn't said anything to me and left me on read multiple times and it seems like he's just not into me anymore. He posted something on Snapchat and it seemed like he was saying he was in a relationship but I just feel like I can never win with guys or with anything in that matter and I just feel stupid for being upset over a guy because I know so many other people have worse problems I just need some advice on to handle a situation like this because I'm not good with this type of stuff.  ",
"​I need help. I have a history of cutting, but its been a while now, almost 3 years. I'm a freshman in college and I have been doing fine for the past month but something has come over me. I need someone to help me I don't want to go back to the way things were before. This past weekend I cut 7 inches off my hair and got a new piercing hoping that it would relive the stress but every time I look in the mirror I see something that I hate and I want to change. I was thinking about not eating to lose weight and I was thinking about going on a strict diet but I know that isn't going to work. My boyfriend doesn't understand what is happening, I've talked to him today about it and he keeps saying that my life is great and that I'm beautiful and don't need to change anything but it isn't like that. I was thinking about suicide and haven't left my chair for two hours because I'm afraid of what I might do when I get up. My friends don't know about this and if they did they would go straight to my parents and I'd probably get a talk about how my family has a history of depression and alcoholism. I don't want to do anything bad to myself but these thoughts are scaring me. I thought I was doing better.",
"​I am struggling. To start, let me explain my family: I am the youngest of 5, and my siblings are all crazy accomplished. One works at Apple, another went to Harvard, etc. but it’s not just academics. They all also have major success in basically every activity, sport, or anything. Next, I am (or at least was) really smart. But this school year has been insane for me. I am involved in so many activities, and I don’t have any free time. Also, many of my activities overlap, which makes me feel awful because I have to choose one, and I am always letting somebody down. My brother that is closest in age to me just went off to college so now I am the only kid at home, and I do not get along with my parents. All around, I am super stressed, I have no free time, and I’m not enjoying anything anymore.",
"​Hello I feel like my family members are always mad or annoyed at me. If I don't respond to something the second after they are ask, they call me rude. They make feel like I'm rude and ungrateful. This doesn't help with my self esteem since I already think bad things about my self, those qualities being affirmed to me doesn't help at all. I don't know how to handle this. ",
​I'm going to be 16 in less than a month. I currently live with my dad but I don't like it here. Can I chose where I wanna live? ,
​I think I have depression idk why but I do. I also want to run away and live with my friend even though I'm 15. I want to do something in the arts so dropping out of school wouldn't do very well for my future.,
"​I am going through a somewhat hard time. I want to start gaining confidence and self-esteem but I feel stuck. I am a community college student. I really want to make changes but there are obstacles and setbacks that seem to come my way. I am determined to fix my confidence and self-esteem problems. I want to let go of all the resentment that I feel. I want to let go of my anxiety. My day was going good until I had a social interaction with a few people. I was pretty awkward and nervous even though I tried to be calm. I shook hands with this person and it came off awkwardly. I don't know how to be calm in social situations. It really brought me down. Now I'm trying to bounce back from it. I'm worried if I came off as disrespectful or rude. I've been shy for the vast majority of my life and I'm READY to change that. I want to stop being shy in so I can have a easier time interacting with others. I want to develop and gain confidence in so I can stop being shy and start feeling good about myself. Sometimes, I hate myself for my horrible social skills. This is why I want to change so badly. Sometimes, I compare myself to others and I realize that's not good. Sometimes, I feel like I failed as a man, and like I'm the weakest person in my world. This is why I want so bad to change my ways. So far, I've made a decision to change my body posture and say affirmations to myself. But I've been inconsistent. I also struggle with a bit of anxiety. Meditation sounds like the best possible solution. So far, listening to music helps with my anxiety. ",
"​Hi, I have a lot of issues, my biggest one is anger towards my sister. I don't know what to do and it has been recently been coming to my attention that it is starting to get very out of hand and becoming very damaging. I don't want to hurt her, I just have a lot of trouble dealing with my emotions and want to get better. I am afraid that I have left her with emotional scars and that I might damage our relationship to the point of no return. Some days I feel like my only option is to run away and never see her again because she is the only one who incites this anger in me and I think it would be better for us in the long run. ",
"​I am talking to you because I am desperate. I don't know what to do. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for seven months now, and the medication is not helping me. If it wasn't for my family and friends I would have killed myself already, but I don't want to let them down. They will feel guilty and I don't want that for them. I want them to be happy, because they deserve it. I am a failure. Everything I do is wrong and I find myself picking my skin to relieve the anxiety and pain I feel within my soul. It's unbearable, keeping me awake at night. Sometimes I think about going to a mental hospital, but I am too scared to go on my own. What will my family think of me? I feel like I am a crazy person. I am worthless, helpless and stupid. I shouldn't be here. I am so sorry to bother you, but I can't talk about this with my loved ones.",
​99% sure I want to kill myself. I'm so close its scary. How my death would affect my mom is the only thing holding me back now ,

"​Hi, you guys helped me a lot when I younger. I just want to say you guys are pretty great. Since talking to you guys, I have really done a lot in my life. In the last year alone, I have moved states, started my dream university and learned how to be an adult. I even went a year with no self harm. Since I have moved twice in less than a year, it is hard to keep a support system. I have made friends at this university and even opened up to an older adult about some of my problems and self harm. There were times where I wanted to die in high school, but because of you guys and others, I am still here and doing well. Thank you guys for your hard work in helping teens and young adults. ",
"​I think I might be developing an eating disorder. I really don't mean to sound dramatic but over the past month I've been eating less and less and exercising way more. I can't stand the feeling of food in my stomach and I haven't had any breakfast or lunch in the past few weeks. Tonight I ate a full meal and I cried afterwards because I could practically feel my whole body inflating. I really don't want to gain weight but I don't want to end up in a hospital either. I asked my therapist about it (I told her it was one of my friends who was dealing with it) and she said these things usually will go away and not develop into a full blown eating disorder. Will it go away? If not, what do I do?",
​I know that these thoughts of suicide that I am having aren't logical but at times I feel like it is the only option I have other than running away. I told someone that I loved them and that I had conflicting feelings and I poured my heart and soul into this message and know they are ignoring me. I know how utterly helpless I sound right now but I just cant seem to walk myself off this ledge to safety. ,
​Hi. So I have been in college for one month so far and I already feel like I am drowning with everything I have to do. I feel like there is not enough time to get everything done. Do you have any tips to help me balance everything? I also have a hard time starting assignments. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.  ,
​I have seen a counselor and have talked to my school about the bullying that is happening to me and they have confronted them but nothing has changed. I am being called names and being bullied 24/7. This has gotten so bad that I have wanted to cut and I have tried to cut. I can't tell my mom or dad because I don't want them to be disappointed in me.  ,
"​Hi my problem is that I am really awkward and boring. I can’t make conversations and even if I have something to talk about I make it very boring. Just this year, I made new friends in my school but as the time passed, I showed them my true nature. I couldn’t make conversations, I was quiet all the time, I was very boring, etc. They started to keep their distance from me, no one talked to me or I didn’t talk to nobody. Out of pity they would kinda at least say hi. I have some physical problems, when I walk so people laugh at me. I go to the physical therapy but nothings working on this. Because I am boring, look weird, am ugly, I don’t have the confidence to talk with a girl. I don’t even know what to do when I get a girlfriend. I don’t even have friends let alone a girlfriend. I have a language problem, I have been here for some years but I can’t speak the language very well , that’s probably because I don’t talk with people. It’s currently affecting my studies. I have constant anxiety while talking with people, when I have to talk in front of a group, my worst nightmare is when I have to do a group work. I NEED HELP PLZ, what should I do ?  ",
​I've tried so hard not to cut but when I'm upset all I can turn to is cutting and I'm trying to stop I don't like the pain and it hurts me so much. I'm scared of everything right now. I'm starting to cut off family and friends and my grades are dropping so much and my dad thinks it me just not trying but I don't think its that I believe it something else. But I just say its that so me and my dad wont argue. I cut again last night. And everyone says its temporary and that I have a good life and I'm a smart kid but I don't feel like that. I feel dumb and I don't think this is temporary. Everyday I have a vision that I'm going to die in high school. I'm scared and I don't know what to do.,
"​I am a senior in high school. There is a guy in one of my classes, that I think I might have a crush on. He was actually in one of my classes last year as well, but we did not pay attention to one another last year whatsoever. He was treating me just like everyone else in the class, and I was doing the same, until last week. When I came into class, he was already in there and walked up to me. He said, 'you were in my class last year right?""' I was a little taken aback by this, him talking to me out of the blue, but I went with it and said 'yeah!' That was it, we just went to our seats after that. Then when we got put into groups for a discussion, we were assigned the same group. When I arrived at my place in the group he smiled at me and waved. Again, I was puzzled by this but just did the same. During his time to talk in the discussion, he only had eyes for me, not the other members of our group at all. After class was over and throughout the long weekend, I found myself constantly thinking about him. Does this mean I like him, or am I just finding him attractive all of a sudden because he is paying attention to me? I'd like to think that I really do have a crush on him, but I am just unsure. Today in class, I really wanted to say hello to him and possibly talk to him for a little bit, but I didn't really get a chance to. During our teacher's lecture, however, we did make eye contact a few times, as we were both just looking around the room. Even though this only happened 2 or 3 times, every time I could see him looking at me I was happy. Is there a possibility that I do like him, not just the idea of him, and is there a possibility that he could be slightly interested in me? Should I make a move or say anything about it to him? I am just so confused and need help because I do not want to do the wrong thing, like tell him I like him and scare him away. If I do tell him I like him, he might find it a little weird, since we barely know each other after all (I mean we've only been classmates, not friends or anything)... Any suggestions to help guide me in this situation"""" Thank you in advance for your help! (Sorry this was long, I like to provide as much detail as possible when I explain things).",

I'm just worried about my lil brother. He is 10. And I love him and always take care of him. We are not the perfect family. It started about a month ago. Our parents started fighting and yelling to each other and to us. Sometimes, I have heard something getting smashed. I don't know what really happened. But I'm just concerned about my brother. I don't want him to be worried. I always put him to sleep every night by reading stories so he will be happy. Also, I don't want him to hear the fight at night. So I try to make him sleep early. And I noticed that my father sleeps on the couch every night. So I talked to my friend about this and told him to keep it secret. I don't want anyone to know. And he told me about this site. And sometimes my bro asked me what's wrong with them? I didn't answer and I quickly changed the topic. I know I cannot do this any longer. Eventually he will know. And I always feel like they're gonna divorce someday. They didn't even want to share a bedroom for weeks. What can I do?",
"​I know this service is not supposed to take the place of therapy, but it's the closest thing I can find. I have a few issues with myself, but the main one is my boyfriend. I love him so much. But he is ready to do things that I just am not ready to do. And I don't think he knows that he's pressuring me to do them. Like, I don't believe that he is doing it purposefully. He just wants to show his love to me, but I just can't accept that right now. And honestly, due to some past sex-related trauma, I know that I won't be ready for any kind of intimacy for a while. And I have told him this, and he's told me that he will wait for me to be ready. But then the next day he asking for kisses and touches and I just can't. I don't want to lose him, so I try to do some things but it feels forced and I don't want to put myself through that but relationships are about compromise and I can't tell him no all the time but I want to. I just... I don't know what to do. We've been together for 5 months now, and he's told me that he wants to be together forever. I do, too- just not like this. I don't know what to do, but I can't do this forever but I can't break up with him because I don't what he'd do if I did and I just love him so much but... I don't know. ",
"​I suffer from extreme anxiety every day all day, some hours it gets worse than others where I lose all control over myself, I have constant issues with my family and my relationship day in and day out, I'm trying really hard to figure out a way so that I can be a functional person at work and in school but I just cant anymore. I'm worried all the time, I have anxiety attacks more than once a day, I'm desperate to get away from everything and I can't. I feel like I cant make anyone one happy and that I never will.  ",
"​I suffer from anxiety. I have a fear of talking in public (especially talking on the phone). People keep telling me that I need to advocate for myself, speak up more, look at someone when they're talking to you, stop being so quiet, and come out of your comfort zone. But for me, that's not very easy. I did read some sources (including yours) about anxiety, but it didn't seem helpful. ",
"​Hello. So there is a girl I made friends with sometime in freshman year but as time went on I started to notice she is bit mean. She will take stuff out my hands without asking such as my phone, she will always ask to copy my homework, also she is a bit homophobic, not to me, she doesn't know my sexuality but she has made some comments that makes me feel uncomfortable and makes me not want to be around her. So during the summer between freshman and sophomore year I didn't hang out with her or talk to her, I hoped that in sophomore year I wouldn't see her much and I could avoid her. I have school tomorrow and I hope I don't have classes with her. I honestly don't know to cut this person out my life and I don't want to deal with her for the rest of high school. ",
"​So I'm a very disorganized person and with school starting up, I really want to have a more organized year than last. There were so much stress and anxiety. If you guys had any tips for being organized or just some nice ways to de-stress and still be focused on school.  ",
"​I go back to school in a week and I'm really nervous for it. Everybody says that junior year is the hardest year, and that worries me a lot, especially because I thought last year was the hardest year of my life. I'm worried I won't do as well in my classes as I'd like, and that none of my teachers will like me. I'm also worried that the friends I have now will leave me for a better group.",
​Worried about friend who says she wants to die and cuts herself on her thighs. There is a two week period before we go back to our boarding school where she would be able to see a therapist. Her parents don't believe in mental illness so I was wondering if there is anything I could try.  ,
"​Hi, I can't believe I'm really doing this but I need help. I've been battling depression for about 2-3 years now. My parents divorced when I was 7 so I had to move. I live with my mom and step dad. I feel about ready to explode. My parents don't know I'm suicidal, depressed, or that I cut. No one I know face to face knows. Only people that I talk to online know. It's gotten pretty bad recently but I haven't cut for 2-3 weeks now. I'm not sure what's wrong with me but I'm so emotional recently and the smallest thing can set me off. Sometimes my suicidal thoughts get so bad. Once I had the knife literally to my throat but then I didn't do it. I was literally outside on the balcony about to jump. I want to die so much. I wish I could just do it but for some reason I'm still here. I need help but I'm afraid to tell my parents or anyone that can tell my parents. Please help me. ",
"​Okay so my parents have been separated for at least a year. They can still get along, but sometimes they still argue and bicker. I'm completely tired of what goes on between them, I just want them to get along. I cant really be on neither of my parents sides, and I don't get in between them when they have arguments. So I honestly am a little concerned that this is gonna end in them getting a divorce, but I just don't even want to anticipate that happening. Do you have any advice for me? ",
"​I am extremely worried about my younger brother. He is acting erratic and has talked to his friends about committing suicide. My parents think I am just over exaggerating and looking too much into his behavior, but even my extended family that doesn't see him very often has noticed a change. I'm not sure what I can do to help him out but I don't want to lose him. ​",
"​My mom is an alcoholic. At first, it was nothing too serious, just beer. This has been going on for about two years now. When I first noticed we got in a fight and she said she would stop drinking, she never even made an appointment. Now she drinks but she hides it, not very well of course. Over the past few days, I have found two bottles of vodka. We fight all the time, she can be emotionally abusive and a few years back she was physically abusive but for the most part, we got that sorted out. Any Advice?? ​​",
"​I don't think my mom likes me very much anymore. I didn't do anything wrong today, but as soon as I got home from my summer program today she asked me to take a break in my room. It's not fair because my brother didn't have to. I asked her why and she said because she wants me to try doing a quiet activity for a while to calm down. Every day she does that at least once. Sometimes for a reason, but sometimes for no reason at all. I was already calm today and I was just looking for batteries and she thinks I’m a maniac or something. I think she was just trying to get me away from her again. I asked her if she doesn't want me around and she said that's not true and she doesn't want me to think that. I think she's lying to me. She doesn't have to worry about me talking too much because I’m not even speaking to her anymore.  ​",
"​A few days ago, I was sexually assaulted by a boy that I was friends with. School is starting soon, and there is a high chance that he will be in my classes. I don't know what to do. I'm scared what will happen if we run into each other. ​​",
"​I'm working on getting along better with my dad, but its really hard. I visit him most weekends and by the day I am leaving he's annoyed with me and angry. I feel like we should be spending our time enjoying each other instead of always avoiding each other or trying not annoy the other person. It actually has started to give me a lot of anxiety about visiting him and a few times I have lied to get out of it and he caught me. That hurt him and I felt very bad about it. He is in counseling for a lot of things and I’m sure whatever he's struggling with he's somehow taking out on me. I don't blame him, but it's not a good feeling. I think what I can do is just try to be cleaner and less “repulsive” when I am at his house. Other than that I’m not sure what I can do. I still don't think I’m that bad because my mom would be on my case as well.  ",
"​Um, Hi I've never been one to beat around the bush so here goes absolutely nothing: I want to die. That felt good to say. I feel like I am worthless and that I'm going to go nowhere in life anyways so that there's no point. I have to wake up everyday and deal with the same people and the same stuff and it's getting tiring. I hate my body, I hate my face, I hate my brain, I hate everything about myself and I'm just really really really tired. But wait, there's more, I don't want to kill myself per se, I just don't look both ways before I cross the street. I don't want to actively kill myself but I don't want to live anymore.",
"​I'm really tired of being told I'm not pushing myself hard enough and I'm tired of being told that's the reason I want to end my life. I pushed away all of my friends, I called out to my parents for help and they don't believe me. They think it's the internet and I've tried so hard to convince them I need help and, to put it simply, I really just want a hug. But I'm tired of trying. I just feel like falling asleep and never waking up now. ​​",
"​I'm feeling so sad and angry. When I start to feel better my conscience reminds me that its all temporary that there's no point of living and trying if we're all going to die in the end. It is making it so hard to have fun and enjoy things I used to. When I seek help from friends Iget the normal response of its going to be okay, stay positive, find something you enjoy and focus on that. Those kinds of responses make me so angry because I just can't enjoy anything anymore and whenever I say something positive my conscience backs it up with something way more negative. I've read some posts on the bulletin board and see the link to coping skills but that's not what I want. I don't want to cope or distract myself from my feelings. I want to get better. I want someone to be brutally honest to me. I want help and at this point I don't have anywhere else to go.  ",
"​I hurt so much, I don't know what to do. A family member passed away from cancer. I can't believe this. Last month it was a good friend who passed away and now this. I feel so bad and I hurt, like my heart is broken now. What do I do? I want to yell and cry so much. I wish that this wasn't happening to me. Please help me if you can. ",
​I'm being cyberbullied and I'm going into a bad mind set. I'm afraid if this gets too far I might do something. Please help me. ,
"​My mom just signed me up for summer camp. It's about job interests and fun activities. At first I was excited, but now I feel scared. I'm worried that I might not survive. I'm worried that I might not make to the restroom. And I'm worried that my belongings will get stolen! My Mom told me to just give it a chance and that I will do fine, but I didn't believe her! I don't know what to do! ",
"Hi, My best friend recently has been getting into drugs and alcohol and going off the rails (giving herself piercings, sneaking out...) and every time I see her she brings it up and offers to me. She either offers smoking or drinking. I've told her, no I'm not doing any drugs and yet she still asks. I've told her I don't support it. I don't feel comfortable hanging out with her anymore because I feel like a bore or that I'm lame. We haven't talked in a little while and I miss her. But I don't miss the new her. Do you have any advice? ​",
"​I've constantly been feeling depressed. It's started in 3rd grade, and has gotten worse. I'm now in 8th grade. I have been having thoughts of suicide. I tend to purposefully not eat to harm myself. I have low self-esteem. I've tried telling my parents about it, but they didn't believe me. Now I really want to get rid of my pain and kill myself. I just need some help and reassurance. ​",
​I guess recently I've really messed up and am pretty overwhelmed. I've started taking some of my friend's antidepressants because my mom doesn't believe in the disorder and I want help. I'm being threatened because of my previously stated mess up. The threats and things people have said have basically made me hate myself. Everything they're saying is partly true and I'm starting to believe it. The whole situation is just making me feel pretty super horrible. I'd love to be able to speak with someone who knows what's up and could actually help me through it. ,
"​I’m not sure if this classifies as assault/sexual assault but the guy held me so I couldn’t leave. He tried kissing me multiple times and I didn’t want to kiss him. I told him to stop but he didn’t. He pulled my hair to keep my head up and he gave me a hickey. I told everyone it was a bruise, friend’s included. But I would like to forget that night ever happened and I don’t know what to do. ​",
"Please help me with an overwhelming challenge to get over. Okay so last night I had to split up my parents fighting. After I saw my dad put his hands on my mom, I was overwhelmed with sadness and anger, and after I threatened to call the cops on him he left. I basically told him to get out of the house. So today I honestly don't want to talk to my dad nor really see him. Please give me advice on how to get past this because this has left me emotionally drained and a little scared of my dad, even though I don't think he would ever hurt me. Is it even normal to experience these emotions? Honestly I could not sleep just thinking about all of this. ​",
"​Okay so recently my parents got into a big argument and now they are getting a divorce. I honestly talked to my mom and like it just wasn't the argument, it was multiple reasons she was divorcing my dad. Honestly right now I feel emotionally drained, a little sad, and angry at them because of this. Do you have any advice for what to do now in this situation and how to just cope? ​​",
"​Hi, I'm sorry to bother you whoever you may be. My parents have been fighting a lot lately and I just need someone to talk to. ​There's probably more important people out there than me though, so it's okay if you don't respond. ​",
"I don't know what to do. My family hates me. All the time they are verbally harassing me. Telling me that I am a terrible person, telling me that I am a disappointment. Anytime I am around them I have to walk on eggshells. I can't win. Nothing I do is right. To them I always have an ulterior motive for everything I do.  ",
