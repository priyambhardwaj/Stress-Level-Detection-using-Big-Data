"​Hello, I have a history of self harm. For the past 6-7 months, I haven't done anything, But in a moment of extreme emotion, I harmed myself again without even thinking. I feel super bad for doing this because I thought that I was getting better. Do y'all have any advice for me? ",Moderate Stress
"My boyfriend's changed, and I don't know what to do about it. He used to be super sweet and caring, and would send me paragraphs about how much he loves me, and cute stuff like that, but recently he hasn't done any of that. All he really does anymore is insult me. And I know he doesn't mean what he says, but it's still super hurtful, because he's someone I really care about. I've tried talking to him about this. We got into a fight last night and I tried ending the relationship. Regarding him not saying cute/sweet things to me anymore he said ""Yeah, I got out of the obsessive phase, I'd rather die than be stuck in that"", he also said that I'm too attached to him. I've been giving him space since he said that. I just miss the way he used to be. I feel like he doesn't care about me anymore. When I tried breaking up with him last night he freaked out, and said I was being stupid, that it was obvious he loved me, but it really isn't. I'm sick of this, but I don't know what to do. I don't want to lose him, but I can't see myself staying with him, either. ",High Stress
I met this guy and got his Snapchat a little while ago. We spoke for a while but he recently stopped opening my messages and I know he's ignoring me because he's posting and his Snapscore is going up. It hurts so much... he's so perfect. How do I deal with this? He's the first boy I have ever truly liked. :( ,Moderate Stress
​My boyfriend isn't okay. I am getting worried about him the longer I let this go on without saying anything. I've tried to talk to him but it doesn't work. He has cut himself and has done worse in past. He breaks down and has panic attacks when we get into fights. I am not the only one scared of what he might do. He refuses to talk to anyone but I can't go on knowing the things that I do. He has threatened to make me watch him hurt himself if I don't keep a promise to him. And tells me that if I leave him he won't be able to handle it. He doesn't want me to say anything to anyone and says that he just wants to talk to me about these things but I can't handle it on my own anymore. I'm scared that one day he won't hesitate to take it a step farther. I don't know what to do and I need help. ,High Stress
"​On Monday I saw my school counselor, and I told her about my cuts. And how I would feel depressed all day. Now my mom knows about my cuts. I feel more relaxed now that she knows. But I still feel like killing myself. I just don’t want to die and leave my family and friends behind. I feel like everything would be more better if I’m dead, I mean it’s probably is, so I don’t have to worried about being stressed and depressed. ",Moderate Stress
​I recently got back in contact with my ex. All of my friends hate him. But every time I see him he makes me the happiest person ever. I think I love him but my friends hate him. What should I do? ,Low Stress
"​I've been feeling really overwhelmed with everything in my life lately. There's a lot of pressure on me to do it all, know who I am and where I'm going, and I'm worried that once high school is over I will be left with no obligations and no idea what I want to do. I'm a straight A student and involved in several different extracurriculars. The world (and my family) tells me that being involved is important to my future, but my hobbies are starting to feel more like chores than fun at this point. I'm so involved in different things I don't know what I actually enjoy doing. I gave up social media, the absence of constant media consumption leaves me with the realization that I'm just empty inside. I guess I'm just tired of being me, of keeping up appearances as the person I'm expected to be. I don't want to be smart or special, I just want to be average. I'm sick of all the expectations put on me because I don't really know who I am. Not to mention I'm not very good at being who I am supposed to be. I'm just anxious, overwhelmed, and alone in the middle. ",High Stress
​I need help I'm depressed and very suicidal. Everybody says I'm not but I have to fake to be happy and hurts me even more knowing that none of them believe me or want to help me. ,Moderate Stress
"​Hello, I am writing to ask how to deal with excessive worry and overthinking. It affects my day all the time and I can’t stop thinking about things, even if I cannot control them. The excessive worrying takes up most of my day and I start to overthink and feel guilty over things. Any advice would be appreciated. This is hard to explain it in writing! ",Moderate Stress
​What do I do when my friends are leaving me out? How do I not become left out? ,Moderate Stress
​There are a lot of people who I know that say things like “I’m gonna kill my self” as a joke or if something goes wrong they immediately resort to saying that. I just never know when people are serious or saying it as a joke or just to say it if something goes wrong. I do want to help. I just never know when they mean it or how to help. ,High Stress
​One of my best friends passed away this summer and I feel like it is consuming my happiness and ability to focus in school or at home and I feel guilty of being alive. How can I get help? ,Moderate Stress
My friend is getting bullied and I want to help but I don't know how? Can you help?,Low Stress
​I’m really messed up over a break up. Should I try to get him back?,Moderate Stress
​I want to die and I would have already killed myself if i weren’t so afraid of how painful death is. I don’t know how to go on it all hurts too bad. I feel like I’m alone and I have no one to talk to. The world isn’t listening to me. ,High Stress
